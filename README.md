### ME!!
I'm Nireekshana Hazel, I prefer Hazel. I'm and final year Electrical Engineering student, who wants to work in a fusion workplace which has both IT and electrical topics, but leaning towards It.I plan to work with F1 in the future. I will make amazing projects, I gotta learn first, but I'm in the process. I strive to be fruitful, even when it's not the season.
